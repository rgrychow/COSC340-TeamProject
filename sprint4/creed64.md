# What you accomplished

This sprint well we were able to figure out the database and collaboration cofusion that we had last sprint and I was able to clean up the fitness tab. I am happy with where it is at.
THis sprint I mainly just worked on cleaning up the buttons and making sure the clickbox was big enough because some of the delete buttons were not covering the entire designated area.
I collabprated with OM and he added a save button to add workouts to the database.
