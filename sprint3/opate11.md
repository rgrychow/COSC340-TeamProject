Problems: 
In this sprint, the biggest problems I had was setting up and configuring the firebase 
database to work with our app. I have user react native to make apps but I have never 
used firebase or any backend before. I wanted to make sure that the structure of the 
data was properly set up so that app development across the whole team stayed smooth.

AI use: 
In this sprint, I used AI mainly to assist in setting up firebase database for the app. 
Since I had no prior experience with firebase, AI was great in guiding me towards setting
up the most optimal firebase - react app. 



Accomplishments:
My accomplishments for sprint 3 were mainly backend related tasks. This was our main goal
for sprint 3 so we are in great shape in terms of schedule. I created a firebase account 
and connected the database to our fitness app. We created a firebase.js file which holds 
the connection to our database. Now you can import the database into any file. I also worked 
on user log in. The user log in / create account page now actually authenticates and connects
to the database. New users are created automatically in the database with their own unique
data. And finally, for the home page, I connected the home page to the database. Now each
user has a unique home page. For example, the "Welcome, [username]" will now display the 
user's name.
