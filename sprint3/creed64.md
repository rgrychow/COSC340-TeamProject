# Sprint 3
**Name:** Camden Reed
**GitHub ID:** clumzycodes
**Group Name:** AimHigh

## What you planned to do
- Make sure that the saved data reflects on the progress tab (Issue #1)
- allow for auto login using database authorization (Issue #2)
- Connect the fitness tab to the firbase(sprint 3) (issue #3)

## What you did not do
- I was not able to push my code onto the project without some issues. I am able to run it locally but we are having some merge issues that we will clean up in sprint 4.

## What problems you encountered
- Trouble with Git pushes / pulls due to divergent branches and needing to install extra software.
- Getting on a good routine / timeline with the team.

# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used AI (ChatGPT) for: 
- Debugging Git push / pull conflicts
- Writing initial templates for files and debugging issues

Also used Node / React built-in packages as 3rd party tools.

# What you accomplished

I was able to accomplish a good amount and was happy with how the sprint turned out.
I was able to connect the fitness tab to the database and allow for auto login with the same account on known devices. I was also able to ensure that the progress tab reflected the saved data on the fitness tab. I was having some merge
issues and I am not sure what code made it to the directory so that is going to be my main focus on sprint 4.
