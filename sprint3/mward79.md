# What I Planned to Do
This sprint I planned on giving more functionality to the settings page. I wanted to do something like other fitness apps
where they calculate the amount of calories you need to hit based on some qualities about yourself. I also planned
to get the dark mode toggle working and trying to connect to the backend.
# What I Did Not Do
I did not end up doing the dark mode toggle. I also did not connect my stuff to the backend yet.
# Problems I Encountered
A problem that I encountered with the dark mode toggle is that I have to go and edit everyone's files. I do not think
it is worth it to edit everyone's and then break the whole functionality of the app. Dark mode is just a cosmetic
feature. I care more about functionality.

# Use of AI
I ended up using Claude to help debug my code. It is really useful to have AI debug in 30 secs instead of you having to find the small error.
# What I Accomplished
I accomplished creating a nutrition calculator that calculates how many calories, protein, fats, and carbs you need
based on qualities about yourself.
