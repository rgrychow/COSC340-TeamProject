# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used AI (ChatGPT) for: 
- Debugging Git push / pull conflicts
- Writing initial templates for hooks and utilities

Also used Node / React built-in packages as 3rd party tools.

# What you accomplished

I was able to accomplish a good amount and was happy with how the sprint turned out.
I added some extra utility to the fitness tab. This included making workouts, sets, and exercises deletable and based off feedback will have presets in sprint 3. I also used a hook to connect the fitness and progress tabs so that the workout info
is displayed on the progress tab. I completed a basic table on the progress tab and ryan added more utility to the progress tab from my connection.
