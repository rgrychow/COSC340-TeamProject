# Sprint 2
  - Matthew Ward
  - mward79 (github and netid)
# What I Planned to Do
  - Create a settings page accessible from the main menu
  - Add an Edit Profile tab
  - Add other tabs like "dark mode" and "about".
# What I Did not Do
  - I did not add functionality to the other tabs besides edit profile.
# Problems I Encountered
  - One problem I came across was getting the settings page to slide from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen and look nice.
# Issues I worked On
  - #25 Add a settings Icon to the home screen
  - #26 Add toggles to the tabs in settings
  - #27 Do the Edit Profile tab
# Files I Worked On
  - AimHigh/AimHigh/app/tabs/home.tsx
  - AimHigh/AimHigh/app/settings_modal.tsx
  - AimHigh/AimHigh/app/edit_profile_modal.tsx
# Use of AI
  - I let AI give me coding snippets of typescript so I could understand how to code in typescript myself.
# What I Accomplished
  - I added a functional settings page accessible through the home page. It has a bunch of tabs and an edit profile tab that is pretty cool. You can change a lot of different things about your profile.
