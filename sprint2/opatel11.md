Problems: 
I mainly had problems with formatting information and user input on all the new pop-up menus I made. We want to keep a cohesion throughout the app so I try to match menu designs to be similar. This is a bit tough when each menu is completely different with completely different information to be displayed.

AI use: 
I used Co-Pilot to help me design and format the home page. AI is good at specific css styles which saves a lot of time when designing a react app.


Accomplishments:
My accomplishments for sprint 2 are all on our home page. In the previous sprint, we finished with a basic home page with only layout done, no functionality. This sprint, we added functionality to those elements as well as a few new features. Our quick access buttons now work fully
Start Run: When clicked, the run menu pops up and prompts the user for target run time. Users can set the time and then click start run for the app to start a run timer.
Start Workout: When clicked, workout menu pops up and user can set the number of target workouts 
Track Meals: When clicked, the track meals menu pops up and the user can add a meal. A new meal item will appear and the user can set the name and all associated macros such as protein, fat, carbs, and calories.
I also added more to the home page top menu bar. Now users can find the search bar, the settings button, and profile button. The settings button changes the settings for the app and the search bar can search information on the app. No data is suggested yet though because we do not have a backend. And finally I added more dynamic data to the fitness preview section. Now users can see step count and water intake each with settable goals.
