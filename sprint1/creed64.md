**Name:** Camden Reed
**GitHub ID:** clumzycodes

## What you planned to do

- Create tabs and fill with dummy data to get a foundation set (Issue #2)
- Create functionallity for fitness tab (issue #3)

## What you did not do
- I was able to complete all my tasks but would like to make each section on fitness tab deletable in sprint 2

## What problems you encountered
- Initially had trouble assignment everybody an equal amount of work.
- Trouble with Git pushes / pulls due to divergent branches and needing to install extra software.
- Getting on a good routine / timeline with the team.
- Having the buttons and spacing figured out on the mobile app compared to web app.

## Issues you worked on
- [#1 Create AimHigh Project](https://github.com/rgrychow/COSC340-TeamProject/issues/1)
- [#2 Create Tabs and Implement Theme](https://github.com/rgrychow/COSC340-TeamProject/issues/2)
- [#3 Implement fitness page function](https://github.com/rgrychow/COSC340-TeamProject/issues/3)

# Files you worked on
- Created all files and made outlines for tabs
- AimHigh/app/(tabs)/fitness.tsx

# Use of AI and/or 3rd party software
I used AI (ChatGPT) for: 
- Debugging Git push / pull conflicts
- Writing initial templates for hooks and utilities

Also used Node / React built-in packages as 3rd party tools.

# What you accomplished

I was able to accomplish a good amount and was happy with how the sprint turned out. I created the project with a basic template so that everyone could work on individual tabs and functionalities. I helped pick a color theme and overall style for the app. I added functionallity to the fitness tab. Which summarizes to be able to create workouts and add exercises to them with sets.

I also learned to manage Git commits properly, including resolving conflicts and ensuring folders appear 
on Github.
