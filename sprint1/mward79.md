# What I Planned to Do
  I planned to get a basic login page, sign up page, and an infographic up and running for the app.
# What I Did Not Do
  I did everything I planned to do.
# Problems I encountered
  The hard part was getting the info tabs to pop up after skipping the login. 
# Issues I Worked On
  - Skip login
  - Sign in page
  - Add a log in page
# File I worked on
  index.tsx
# How I Used AI
  I used AI to debug my code. I also used it to help teach me the basics of typescript.
# What I Accomplished
  I made a login page, a sign up page, and a skip login button. When you hit the skip login,
  it takes you to the pop-ups that explain how all the tabs work. When you sign up, you 
  get a message in the terminal with your username and password.
