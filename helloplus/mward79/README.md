# Fitness Tracker
  This app is very basic. It has two buttons - "Log Workout" and "View Progress" that when you click on, they 
  give you a little pop-up notification.
# How to run
  - Open Powershell
  - Clone this repository -> ``git clone https://github.com/rgrychow/COSC340-TeamProject.git``
  - Navigate to directory -> ``cd COSC340-TeamProject/helloplus/mward79/my-fitness-tracker``
  - Run ``npm install``
  - Run ``npm start`` or ``npm expo start``
  - You can load the app in a browser or scan the QR code that pops up and run it on EXPO GO app.
  - Error about ''node_modules'' â†’ ''delete node_modules/'' and run ''npm install'' again.
# How it might Help
  This basic project adds buttons that will eventually lead to different tabs and functionalities.
  It is also essential that I know how to compile my code into an app format.
